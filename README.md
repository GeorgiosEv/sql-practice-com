# 💻📝📊🗄️ SQL-practice.com - Practice your SQL skills

In an attempt to brush up our SQL querying skills, my friend and colleague Vasileios Tsakalos (https://github.com/Tsaqeal) suggested https://www.sql-practice.com.

The sandbox environment utilises two different databases:
1. **hospitals.db**
2. **northwind.db**

The difficulty levels for both databases are the same:
- Easy
- Medium
- Hard

What you will find in the repository is our attempts to solve the puzzles in a way that works and makes sense (rationally). We do realise that there are alternatives (which, we will provide in some cases) or simpler ways and we welcome you to leave comments or code improvements.

We would definitely appreciate your (constructive) feedback and further contribution.

Thank you.
