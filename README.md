# 💻📝📊🗄️ SQL-practice.com - Practice your SQL skills

In an attempt to brush up our SQL querying skills, my friend and colleague Vasileios Tsakalos (https://github.com/Tsaqeal) suggested https://www.sql-practice.com.

What you will find in the repository is our attempts to solve the puzzles in the simplest way possible.

We would definitely appreciate your (constructive) feedback and further contribution.

Thank you.
