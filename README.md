# 💻📝📊🗄️ SQL-practice.com - Practice your SQL skills

In an attempt to brush up our SQL querying skills, my friend and colleague Vasileios Tsakalos (https://github.com/Tsaqeal) suggested https://www.sql-practice.com.

The sandbox environment utilises two different databases:
1. **hospitals.db**
2. **northwind.db**

The difficulty levels for both databases are the same:
- Easy
- Medium
- Hard

Numbers of exercises per database:
| Difficulty⬇️ / Database➡️| hospital.db | northwind.db |
| -------------------------| ----------- | ------------ |
| Easy                     | 16          | 9            |
| Medium                   | 26          | 4            |
| Difficult                | 10          | 2            |

** I am not entirely sure whether the exercises increase over time (with new ones being added), but I will update the existing repository, should new exercises are added.

What you will find in the repository is our attempts to solve the puzzles in a way that works and makes sense (rationally). We do realise that there are alternatives (which, we will provide in some cases) or simpler ways and we welcome you to leave comments or code improvements. 

The language and the syntax used was **basic SQL** (with some intermediate combinations) in a way that would work universally (as along the way, we have realised there are some compatibility issues with the use of certain functions in the online environment).

We would definitely appreciate your (constructive) feedback and further contribution.

Thank you.
